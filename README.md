# coloursound
App in Swift 5 for soundscape generation via painting - requires AudioKit and MaLiang frameworks adding to project folder.
AudioKit: https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit
MaLiang: https://github.com/Harley-xk/MaLiang

This app allows you to touch-paint using MaLiang's paint rendering frameworks in Metal. This allows for touch-sensitive painting
according to how much of your finger you choose to paint with. Based on the colours you paint with and their ratios of size on the screen,
the app generates a relaxing soundscape using synthesizers in AudioKit, inspired by sedative music in music therapy. This soundscape will add more tones and notes to itself
as more colours are added to the screen, which change in diatonic mode depending on which colour is most prevalent. Erase functionality is also provided.
